This repository is the successor to:
- https://github.com/Pitt-JonesLab/quantum_logical
- https://github.com/PITT-HATLAB/corral_crowding
- https://github.com/evmckinney9/transpile_benchy
- https://github.com/evmckinney9/workspace

which were intended to be project-agnostic bespoke tools for my quantum simulation research. In other words, whatever wrappers I use for qiskit/qutip/etc coding. For example, `quantum_logical` contained kraus operator definitions for qutrit error channels and an accompanying Trotter product simulator. Also, `transpile_benchy` is a wrapper of `Qiskit.transpiler` with matplotlib visuals. The intention is to unify my standard research tools and visualization code.
